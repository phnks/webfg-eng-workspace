Fix Docker Compose Compatibility Issues
======================================

This script addresses the 'ContainerConfig' error that occurs with older 
Docker Compose versions (like 1.29.2) when trying to start containers.

The error happens because older Docker Compose versions can't properly 
handle container metadata from newer Docker versions.
